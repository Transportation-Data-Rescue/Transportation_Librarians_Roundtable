Rather than remediating them after the fact, learn how to create your documents with accessibility in mind from the start. Though not an intensive, in-depth training, this presentation will guide you through features in MS Word and MS PowerPoint that will help make a good faith effort.

          "Speaker Bio: Ms. Kevyn Barnes is the Manager of Library Services at the TxDOT Research Library (operated at the Center for Transportation Research-UT Austin) and has served as its webmaster since 2010. Her focus is on the capture of knowledge, cataloging, and dissemination of transportation research materials and information, particularly via web services. She actively works with the TxDOT’s Research & Technology Implementation Division to develop and improve library web resources and oversees the library’s social media and other methods of outreach. In 2014, the University of Texas at Austin mandated that all websites on its domain meet minimum accessibility scores of 90% compliance with WCAG 2.0 Level AA, per statutory requirements in Texas Administrative Code 206.70 Accessibility Standards (TAC 206.70). Because the library’s catalog made up almost half of the Center’s web pages, she was responsible for bringing the Center’s score up from 24% compliance to over 90% in just a few months. Now that the website has achieved a stable score of 99% conformance, she has turned her focus to the electronic documents that the library hosts for free online access. Although not an expert in the field of accessibility, she will relay what she has learned and provide information about tools that she uses to create accessible documents."],

        "dc.description.abstract":["Are you responsible for creating electronic documents that are shared with the public or even internally with coworkers? Do you post PDFs, images, or other documents to your website, intranet, or on social media? To be more inclusive--and to meet legal requirements--you need know how to make your documents accessible. Rather than remediating them after the fact, learn how to create your documents with accessibility in mind from the start. Though not an intensive, in-depth training, this presentation will guide you through features in MS Word and MS PowerPoint that will help make a good faith effort. This presentation is intended to help you take steps to be more inclusive to patrons and coworkers of all abilities and to become an accessibility liaison at your organization, encouraging others to learn these necessary skills.",
